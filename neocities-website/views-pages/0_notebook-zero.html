          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>&#09;Hello! If you found yourself reading this, I am both glad and proud of you! Glad because you have shown interest in one of my “less shareable” interests, and proud because you may or may not be sharing some of them with me.
</p>
          <p>&#09;But first off - what is this?
What you’re reading right now is the introductory “Notebook Zero” of my “Omega Notebooks” (<strong>ω Notebooks</strong>) series. It’s a collection of digital notebooks which I use to neatly catalogue all kinds of notes I make about parts of science, technology, engineering, math and other fields which I find interesting!
The main aim of these notebooks is to index all of the knowledge that I gather over time and make it easier for me to revise or relearn it, explaining and expanding upon each subject in a way that is easy, digestible and sufficiently thorough for me to understand (and fun to read), compared to rummaging through textbooks, PDFs and online articles in an utter state of confusion.
  I’m also mostly writing it for pure enjoyment, as I just really love learning about how this world works.
</p>
          <p>&#09;In the next few paragraphs, I will try to explain some important rules, the structure and format of this project, mayhaps its history, handling of updates & exports and what exactly I plan to do with it.
