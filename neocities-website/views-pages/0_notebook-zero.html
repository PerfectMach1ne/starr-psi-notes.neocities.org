          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>&#09;Hello! If you found yourself reading this, I am both glad and proud of you! Glad because you have shown interest in one of my “less shareable” interests, and proud because you may or may not be sharing some of them with me.
</p>
          <p>&#09;But first off - what is this?
What you’re reading right now is the introductory “Notebook Zero” of my “Omega Notebooks” (<strong>ω Notebooks</strong>) series. It’s a collection of digital notebooks which I use to neatly catalogue all kinds of notes I make about parts of science, technology, engineering, math and other fields which I find interesting!
The main aim of these notebooks is to index all of the knowledge that I gather over time and make it easier for me to revise or relearn it, explaining and expanding upon each subject in a way that is easy, digestible and sufficiently thorough for me to understand (and fun to read), compared to rummaging through textbooks, PDFs and online articles in an utter state of confusion.
  I’m also mostly writing it for pure enjoyment, as I just really love learning about how this world works.
</p>
          <p>&#09;In the next few paragraphs, I will try to explain some important rules, the structure and format of this project, mayhaps its history, handling of updates & exports and what exactly I plan to do with it.
</p>
          <h3>The ω Notes Manifesto</h3>
          <div class="manifesto"><ol><li id="1">The ω Notes Notebooks as a whole is, before all, a personal handbook/formatted note stash/encyclopædia/textbook-like passion project that is forever meant to have one and only one direct contributor.</li><li id="2">It shall never be ‘finished’. This project is, before all - for me & everyone curious in its areas of study only.
Neither of us in our lifetimes can comprehend or memorize the entire scope of each general STEM+ field that ω Notes will touch upon. Thus we do not attempt to achieve an ultimate, perfect, completion and categorization of knowledge.
</li><li id="3">None of the notes are set in stone or immune to being wrong or due for a revision. To strive is to err, and to err is to learn no less than from succeeding. If you see something wrong or stupid in the Notebook, point it out to me. If you see something in the notebooks that - as a written text alone - is dangerous, inform me about it. Criticize everything here like a researcher and truth seeker, not like an ass.
</li><li id="4">Formerly, Notebook Zero was meant to contain rules and “Terms and Conditions” with certain strict, albeit unenforceable rules. I have since revised this pointless pile of text. “Pirate” these Notebooks, even if there is nothing to ‘pirate’. Knowledge and experience shouldn’t cost anything other than your time, emotions and thoughts. But know that I might be wrong and I may be sometimes stupid, and so whatever you find in these notebooks may either lead you to some truth or a good place, or lie to you and lead you astray.
</li><li id="5">These notebooks strive for perfection and truth that cannot be attained in any ideal state. This is not a contradiction of statement 2., but a statement of dedication to a following certain ideal in how every note is written here, even if we can never achieve this ideal - just as infinite limits of mathematical analysis & calculus, and just like the absolute temperature of the third law of thermodynamics.
</li><li id="6">I write all of this for not only truth seeking and genuine interest in the sciences, but also for pure fun and perpetual self-development. It is as much entertainment to me, as it is a serious dedicated striving.
</li><li id="7">I will never make a notebook dedicated to IT (Information Technology), CS (Computer Science), programming, or any synonymous or related name of a study/engineering field. There will be concepts from those things scattered across many-a notebooks, but I am not making a notebook just for any of those things. It’s just not happening~~!
</li><li id="8">Many faulty or imperfect schooling systems, as well as pseudo-scholarly prisonic institutions failed, continue to fail, and will never cease to fail to teach the things that I attempt to relearn & self-teach myself via the assistance of these prettily formatted, informal notebooks.
It is a personal textbook & lesson full of ‘heresy’ and fire that engulfs every garbage textbook & lesson I’ve survived.
</li><li id="9"><strong><i><emphasis>[Whatever else I will consider important to put here in the future~!]</emphasis></i></strong></li></ol></div>

          <h3>Conventions in the Notebooks</h3>
          <p>[bweeh]</p>
          <h3>Notebook structure and format</h3>
          <p>&#09;I feel like the first potential question that needs to be addressed is “why the pee background?”. Long story short, I don’t want to burn my eyes with all the whiteness of the pages. I can also recall looking up things like “best color for studying/remembering” and “least tiring color to look at” on Google, and for some reason, influenced by my Google searches I choose this specific tint of yellow.
But hey, it doesn’t have to be the only association that comes to your mind when you look at it. To me, it just looks like pages of a very old book:
</p><br>
          <pre style="text-align: center;">[[[PLACEHOLDER TEXT FOR IMAGE I'M GETTING WITH AN API MANUALLY]]]</pre>
          <br><p>I also want to instantly get it out of the way, that I tend to write temporary notes to self or ‘rough drafts’ as some form of text in square brackets [], i.e.:
</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">[if a &gt; b and b &gt; c then a &gt; c, (&lt;-write this more nicely later)]
</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">[TODO: put the pic of a  graph you drew there]
</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">[I like to eat fish and rocks sdjsafbsajgs4i32743817]
</p>
          <p>Try not to mistake those for square brackets in mathematical/physical formulas or source code; I’ll try my best to make it easy to tell those apart, though.
</p>
          <p>&#09;The next important thing is the organization of notebooks itself.
I write everything into separate files called notebooks, each of which corresponds to an individual field of study. Some notebooks make, so to speak, ‘families’ of notebooks, by being separate notebooks about the same subject, i.e.: Math 1, Math 2 and Math 3 or Chemistry 1 & Chemistry 2. Each notebook also has an ID, which is just a convenient shortcut to help navigate all the notes using Table of Contents.
</p>
          <p>&#09;Now, Table of Contents - this is a spreadsheet file, just like in Microsoft Excel. The first sheet should be an example sheet, where you will find nothing of use, except for a big blue box with text that states exactly that. You will have to choose and click one of the individual sheets at the bottom of the page; each sheet corresponds to a family of notebooks, so if there are, for example, 5 biology notebooks (unlikely example but go on, me), the Biology sheet should function as the table of contents for all five notebooks!
</p>
          <p>The ToC sheet structure should look like this:</p>
          <pre style="text-align: center;">[[[PLACEHOLDER TEXT FOR IMAGE I'M GETTING WITH AN API MANUALLY]]]</pre>
          <br><p>Chapters and subchapters represent the organizational divisions within each notebook. You should use these to find the specific note topics you are interested in reading about.
</p>
          <p>To find where these notes are, use the ‘Notebook ID’ and ‘Pages’ columns. You can’t see that in the picture above, but in situations when a notebook family has more than 1 notebook, it will be explicitly stated from which notebook individual pages come from.
</p>
          <p>There is also a “completeness” column. It is supposed to inform you of the state of each notebook, chapter and subchapter. Green “Complete” status implies that the information in a chapter should be 100% ready to be “consumed”, but does not rule out potential future updates and improvements!
</p>
          <p>Yellow “Almost complete” and orange “Incomplete” imply that the notebook/chapter/subchapter is unfinished and/or currently being worked on.</p>
          <p>Red-orange “Unpolished” means the current state of the notebook/chapter/subchapter is that of a crude list of messy notes - I have started working on it, but the polishing, ‘refactoring’ and “prettying” process is yet to begin!
</p>
          <p>Red “Not started yet” means that the notebook/chapter/subchapter in question doesn’t exist yet, but is planned and will start being worked on relatively soon.
</p>
          <p>Light blue “Planned” implies that the notebook/chapter/subchapter has been planned to start being worked on at an unspecified future date.</p>
          <p>In some weird cases, there may be “foreign family” notebook references in the sheets, but that should be a quite rare occurrence. These are going to be marked with a dim purple “Present elsewhere”.
</p>
          <p>Ominously gray “Due for a rewrite” means that there is something really wrong with this chapter and I want to fix it by scrapping it and starting anew. It also means that until its completeness stops being ‘gray’, its contents are probably really stupid and you should probably avoid it like plague.</p>
          <p>&#09;At the start of every chapter I’m going to attempt compiling a list of “recommended prerequisites”, AKA things that I recommend getting familiar with before diving into a chapter and expecting to understand whatever’s written in it.
</p>
          <p>&#09;In the STEM-oriented (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, that kind of stuff) families of notebooks, you may occasionally encounter special sections.
</p>
          <p>The first type is addendums/annotations. You should be able to spot those by a orange box with a text of the same color preceded by a star at the top of the table:</p>
          <h3>“Version” control</h3>
